## AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project

### Introduction
Welcome to the AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project! This initiative is focused on extracting insights from various datasets, including bookings, hotels, and rooms, to understand occupancy trends, revenue patterns, and booking platform preferences. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, we aim to facilitate informed decision-making for hotel management and optimize business operations.

### Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive process of data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and analysis of AtliQ Hotels' data. Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, we uncover valuable insights to support strategic planning and operational enhancements for AtliQ Hotels.
